With MDK-ARM toolchain, a simple putchar function executes a SWI and activates 
a low level putchar function. 
You have to redirect the low level to your own implementation of these functions.

To guarantee that no functions using the semihosting SWI are included in your 
application, either:

1. Ensure that the MicroLib option is checked since the microlib does not support
semihosting
or 
2. Use
- IMPORT __use_no_semihosting_swi from assembly language
- #pragma import(__use_no_semihosting_swi) from C.
